# Daxturus's Fractal Generator
A JavaScript tool that, when run, automatically generates a fractal using a custom fractal generator I wrote. I'm not sure if anyone has used this method of fractal generation yet; I may very well have created an entirely new kind of fractal set. At the very least, it generates a bunch of different types of fractals in one output.
At the moment, it's a bit buggy. It often gives undefined values as outputs, causing a noticeable slowdown in generation time, and loss of colored pixels in certain regions (Fractal boundaries remain, in the grand majority of cases, completely unaffected). But, on the bright side, it works, and I'm finally free from this horrible curse of nonstop working on this project. I can go do my homework now.

Controls:
WASD: Move up and down.
+/-: Zoom in or out.
M/N: Increase or decrease the simulation steps per pixel accordingly.
I/K: Increase or decrease the canvas size accordingly.
O: Download fractal data.
P: Capture image of canvas.
L: Load generated fractal data.
