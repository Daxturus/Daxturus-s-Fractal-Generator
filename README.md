# Daxturus-s-Fractal-Generator
A JavaScript tool that, when run, automatically generates a fractal using a custom fractal generator I built. I'm not sure if anyone has used this method of fractal generation yet; I may very well have created an entirely new kind of fractal set.
At the moment, it's a bit buggy. It often shoots out "undefined" values. But, on the bright side, it works.

Controls:
WASD: Move up and down.
+/-: Zoom in or out.
M/N: Increase or decrease the simulation steps per pixel accordingly.
I/K: Increase or decrease the canvas size accordingly.
O: Download fractal data.
P: Capture image of canvas.
L: Load generated fractal data.
